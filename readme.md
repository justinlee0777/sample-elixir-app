# HelloWorld

Application used to learn Elixir. Currently scripts are only ran through the Elixir VM.

TODOs:
1) Think of a test main script.
2) Automate build.
3) Revert app to use Phoenix and act as a web resource. Use a public API, like MovieDB.

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `hello_world` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:hello, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/hello](https://hexdocs.pm/hello).
